# temporal_evolution_prediction
This repository contains code that can be used to train a neural network that can predict temporal evolution of non-linear partial differential equation solutions, specificallyt the 1D Burger's Equation. Files dedicated to data generation, pre-processing, and model testing are also present. Instructions to run this code locally are provided below.

1. Python 3.0 is required to utilize the code in this repository.
2. Download all the files present in the repository.
3. Open any Command Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal.
4. Navigate to the location where the file "Visocus Burger's Equation" has been installed.
5. Run the command: "python .\burger_evolution_prediction.py" (exclude double quotes) to train the model.
6. Run the command: "python .\testing_nn.py" (exclude double quotes) to see how the model performs on a randomly generated training sample.
7. Repeat step 6 to check the model performance for different training examples.
